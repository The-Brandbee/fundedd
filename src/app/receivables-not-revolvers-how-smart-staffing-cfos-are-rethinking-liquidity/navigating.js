                <h4>Receivable Factoring Is Replacing Bank Revolvers</h4>
<p>For years, middle-market staffing firms have defaulted to the bank revolver as their primary liquidity tool. The logic was simple: secure a line of credit, leverage it against receivables, and smooth cash flow while waiting on client payments. But in today’s environment, that model is increasingly being challenged. A confluence of factors, including higher rates, regulatory scrutiny, and bank retrenchment, is forcing CFOs to reevaluate the cost and efficiency of their funding stack.</p>
<p>And the verdict is becoming clear: receivable factoring is not just a stopgap. For a growing number of staffing executives, it is the strategic replacement for revolvers.</p>

<h4>The Bank Revolver Model Is Cracking</h4>
<p>Historically, the revolver has been attractive for one reason: cost. When benchmark rates were low and underwriting was relatively straightforward, accessing liquidity through a line of credit looked efficient. But post-2022, several structural changes have eroded that advantage:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interest Rate Pressure:</strong> With SOFR climbing and spreads widening, the all-in cost of bank credit is up materially, often pushing double digits for middle-market borrowers.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance Overhead:</strong> Banks are imposing tighter covenants, higher collateral coverage, and frequent audits. For CFOs, this translates to more time managing compliance than managing working capital.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced Appetite:</strong> Regional banks, once the backbone of staffing finance, have pulled back in the wake of balance sheet pressures, leaving firms with fewer options and stricter terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, revolvers no longer provide the flexibility staffing firms need in an economy where payroll obligations are weekly, but receivables can stretch 45, 60, or even 90 days.</p>

<h4>Why AR Factoring Is Outpacing Traditional Credit</h4>
<p>Receivable factoring, long dismissed as “expensive capital,” is being reappraised through a different lens. Leading CFOs are realizing that its benefits align more closely with the operational realities of staffing than a revolver ever did.</p>
<h4>1.Scalability with Growth</h4>
<p>Revolvers often cap out just as firms are scaling, a paradox when liquidity is needed most. AR factoring scales naturally with revenue. As invoice volume grows, so does available liquidity. This removes the artificial ceilings that revolvers impose.</p>
<h4>2.Liquidity Certainty</h4>
<p>Bank borrowing bases fluctuate with compliance testing and collateral recalculations. Factoring, by contrast, provides predictable liquidity tied directly to invoice performance, which is a more transparent and controllable variable for CFOs.</p>
<h4>3.Reduced Administrative Drag</h4>
<p>With factoring partners, much of the collections and credit monitoring is offloaded. This reduces internal overhead while simultaneously improving receivable quality, an efficiency that banks rarely provide.</p>
<h4>4.Strategic Optionality</h4>
<p>Beyond liquidity, factoring improves optionality. By converting receivables into an asset that drives capital formation, firms can allocate internal bandwidth toward growth, acquisitions, or margin expansion, rather than compliance firefighting.</p>

<h4>The High-Interest Environment: A Catalyst, Not a Constraint</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The relative cost of factoring is often more competitive than assumed. All-in costs for revolvers, once single-digit, now edge close to factoring levels.</li>
  <li>The risk-adjusted value is higher. The certainty and scalability of factoring outweigh marginal cost differences when weighed against the downside risk of missing payroll or breaching covenants.</li>
  <li>The opportunity cost of constrained liquidity is enormous. Delayed expansion or lost client contracts due to capital friction often outweigh the savings on paper from traditional credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sense, factoring is not simply a liquidity solution; it is a growth enabler in environments where bank capital is structurally constrained.</p>

<h4>Strategic Implications for Staffing CFOs</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Balance Sheet Flexibility:</strong> Factoring avoids layering restrictive debt onto the balance sheet, creating a cleaner financial profile for future M&amp;A or equity raises.</li>
  <li><strong>Client Risk Mitigation:</strong> By outsourcing receivable diligence and collections, firms gain a more objective view of client creditworthiness, which informs sales strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Future-Proofing:</strong> As regulatory oversight of banks intensifies, the agility provided by factoring reduces exposure to systemic shocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not incremental advantages. They are fundamental shifts in how staffing CFOs manage both liquidity and risk in a market that rewards speed and adaptability.</p>

<h4>The Future of Receivable Factoring</h4>
<p>Looking ahead, receivable factoring is poised to play an even greater role in middle-market staffing finance. As interest rate volatility persists and banks remain cautious, factoring firms are innovating. Dynamic pricing models, deeper sector expertise, and integration with payroll systems are elevating factoring from a financing product into a strategic platform.</p>
<p>The most forward-looking CFOs are no longer asking, “Should I use factoring instead of a revolver?” They are asking, “How can factoring become the backbone of my liquidity strategy in a world where flexibility beats cost every time?”</p>

<h4>Why Fundedd</h4>
<p>At Fundedd, we believe receivable factoring is not a fallback, instead, it is the future. Our approach combines independent credit expertise with a relationship-driven model, designed to align liquidity with your growth trajectory. For staffing CFOs navigating a high-interest, compliance-heavy market, the choice is not between revolvers and factoring. The choice is between rigidity and flexibility, between reactive liquidity and proactive growth.</p>
<p><strong>Receivables, not revolvers, are defining the next era of staffing finance.</strong> The question is: are you ready to rethink liquidity?</p>
