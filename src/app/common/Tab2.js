        <p>Begin by submitting your outstanding invoices to Fundedd. Our team will carefully review and verify their eligibility for factoring, ensuring that the invoices meet the necessary criteria. This step is crucial to streamline the process and avoid any disruptions, enabling you to access funds faster and more efficiently.</p>

     <p>Once your invoices are approved, Fundedd provides you with an advance of 80%-95% of the total invoice value upfront. For example, if you have an invoice worth $10,000 and the agreed advance rate is 90%, youâ€™ll receive $9,000 immediately. This immediate cash infusion helps meet your operational needs without waiting for customer payments.</p>

     <p>Fundedd retains a small portion of the invoice value, typically 8-10%, as a security buffer. This retained amount ensures that we can cover any potential risks during the payment cycle. Once your customer pays the invoice in full, this amount (minus fees) is released to you, completing the transaction seamlessly.</p>
